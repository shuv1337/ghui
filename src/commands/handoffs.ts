// Bridge between command Effects and hook-bound imperative actions.
//
// Some commands run logic that genuinely can't flow through atoms:
//   - `preserveDiffLocation` reads a scrollbox.scrollTop synchronously
//     *before* the atom write that triggers re-render, so the snapshot
//     captures the pre-mutation state. Atoms only let us subscribe after.
//   - `quit` calls OpenTUI's renderer.destroy(); the renderer is the
//     React component's `useRenderer()` and has no atom counterpart.
//   - Modal openers like `openThemeModal` derive seed state from many
//     atoms + hook-local computed values (systemAppearance, themeId).
//
// Each command's React owner registers its imperative implementation here
// on mount; the command body calls `invokeHandoff` inside `Effect.sync`.
//
// Kept intentionally tiny (one shared slot map) so it's obvious that this
// is a side-channel, not a parallel registry. Commands whose run is
// atom-pure should not use this — they yield Atom.update/set directly.
